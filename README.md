## CZShopper Shopping List

This is an Android (Gingerbread/2.3+) app to manage a shopping list.

It provides online saving/editing via the CZShopper API, and also allows offline read access.

The app allows a "pull to refresh" operation on the main list. This being such a common idiom, I did not implement it myself but instead chose to use the open-source [Android-PullToRefresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh) library written by [Chris Banes](https://github.com/chrisbanes).
